        <p>In my search for boardgames for me and my friend it was a hard search of the internet to not get recommended romantic games for adults.
            This gave me my mission to do this website with boardgames, without scrolling through the boardgames you wouldnâ€™t be interested in.
            I have search trough others top recommened boardgames according to users. Now I have summed up top 10 boardgames thats fun for two people. <br>
            Hope you find your favorite.
